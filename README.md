### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Doctoral researcher at the [Max-Planck Institute](https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/en) studying laser-induced micro explosions to better understand the properties of liquids. I extensively do image processing and analysis along with a multitude of data science projects as part of my Ph.D. as well as a hobby. 

I am interested in the application of machine learning tools (when and if needed) in deriving solutions to complex problems in fields such as finance (anomaly detection, credit approval etc..), computer vision and natural language processing. **Especially NLP!** :) 
## Deployment ready projects
- [Sentiment analysis for motorcycle based on reddit comments](https://github.com/meghanad-kayanattil/motorcycle-sentiment)

## Projects related to my Ph.D 

- [Electron diffraction simulation](https://github.com/meghanad-kayanattil/Electron-diffraction)
- [2D plot to 3D surface creation](https://github.com/meghanad-kayanattil/2D-to-3D-by-rotation-about-an-axis)

## Other machine learning and data science projects

- [A combination of smaller projects](https://github.com/meghanad-kayanattil/Data_Science_Python_notebooks)


I will be sharing more of my works when I can (since some are part of scientific publications). Watch this space for more ðŸ˜„

If you find my work interesting and would like to contact, find me:
