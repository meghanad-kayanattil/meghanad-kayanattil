### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I did my Ph.D. at the [Max-Planck Institute](https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/en) studying laser-induced micro explosions to better understand the properties of liquids. I extensively did image processing and analysis along with a multitude of data science projects as part of my Ph.D. as well as a hobby. 

I am interested in the seamless integration of software and state-of-the-art hardware to solve difficult problems. 

## Deployment ready ML projects
