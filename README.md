### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Doctoral researcher studying laser-induced micro explosions to better understand the properties of liquids. I extensively do image processing and analysis along with a multitude of data science projects as part of my Ph.D. as well as a hobby. 

I am interested in the application of machine learning tools (when and if needed) in deriving solutions to complex problems in fields such as finance, autonomus driving (computer vision) and smart farming. 

If you are interested in knowing more about my PhD work you can find some tit-bits here : [Linlk](https://github.com/meghanad-kayanattil/Electron-diffraction)

If you are interested in knowing more about my data science projects in finance, they can be found here : [Link]()

For computer vision related projects visit : [Link]()

I will be sharing more of my works when I can (since some are part of scientific publications). Watch this space for more ðŸ˜„

If you find my work interesting and would like to contact, find me in ![href = https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghanad-kayanattil/]({https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0077B5?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white})
