### Hi there 👋

I am a Doctoral researcher at one of the [Max-Planck Institute](https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/en) studying laser-induced micro explosions to better understand the properties of liquids. I extensively do image processing and analysis along with a multitude of data science projects as part of my Ph.D. as well as a hobby. 

I am interested in the application of machine learning tools (when and if needed) in deriving solutions to complex problems in fields such as finance, autonomus driving (computer vision) and smart farming. 

## Projects related to my Ph.D 

- [Electron diffraction simulation](https://github.com/meghanad-kayanattil/Electron-diffraction)
- [2D plot to 3D surface creation](https://github.com/meghanad-kayanattil/2D-to-3D-by-rotation-about-an-axis)

## Machine learning and other data science projects

I will be sharing more of my works when I can (since some are part of scientific publications). Watch this space for more 😄

If you find my work interesting and would like to contact, find me:
